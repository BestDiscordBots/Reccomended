**Summary:** 
This discord bot is a must. It’s not as user friendly, but that comes with a good discord bot. Fortunately the dashboard makes setup a little easier. The bot features advanced anti-raid, ant-nuke, and anti-spam. Manual bot commands are very advanced as well. If you feel a need to verify new members, the bot can do that as well. Let’s start with the anti-nuke system: If a user does dangerous things like kicking/banning many users in a short period of time, the bot takes action. Wick then qurantines all members that participated in the raid. A quarantine is when all roles & permissions are removed and the user is given the qurantine role. The qurantine role makes it so the user can’t do anything, not even see channels. The anti-spam system can detect bad words, spam, malicious websites, NSFW. It’s very customizable so you can set a custom action when a user sends an attachment or mentions an amount of users. Verification allows owners to send new members a captcha. Moderation commands are very advanced. You can purge messages based on requirements, lockdown channels, ban multiple members, and much more. This moderation bot features more moderation features than any other discord bot. This means that if you have wick in your server, you woudn’t need any other bots with moderation bot.
